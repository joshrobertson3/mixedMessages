This project is the Mixed Messages portfolio project from Codecademy.

The purpose of this project is to create a fully randomised but coherent sentence using 2 substantive nouns, 1 pronoun, 1 verb, 3 adjectives and 1 adverb.

This project is split into:
    - Word Repository
        - 1 parent class (Word), and these child classes:
            - Nouns
            - Pronouns
            - Verbs
            - Adjectives, and
            - Adverbs
    - Main
        - Assembler function which
            - Calls on the word classes using their randomiser methods to get the required words
            - Assembles the words into a coherent sentence using gramatical rules (simplified - SVO)

This project can be extended in the future to include prepositions, conjunctions and more complicated sentence structures.
